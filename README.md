Python practice FizzBuzz (Makers Academy Week 5)
=====================
start ```python3``` on MacOS in the tests/ directory.<br/>
```import FizzBuzz```<br/>
```FizzBuzz.check(number)``` where number is any integer you want will give you a result of Fizz if the number is divisible by 3, Buzz if it's divisible by 5, FizzBuzz if it's divisible by both, and return the number if it's not any of the above.
You can also run FizzBuzz itself and get it to give you the results from 1 to 100.
